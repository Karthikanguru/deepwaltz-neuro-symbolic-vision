# DeepWaltz: Neuro-Symbolic Scene Understanding

DeepWaltz is a research prototype that integrates learned perception
with symbolic constraint satisfaction for explainable scene reasoning.

The system is inspired by the classical Waltz line-labeling framework
and extends it using modern neural perception.

## Features

- Learned junction classification
- Symbolic constraint satisfaction
- Single-hypothesis scene inference
- Planar surface reasoning
- Explainable output

## Running the Demo

Run the script directly:

```bash
python deepwaltz.py
